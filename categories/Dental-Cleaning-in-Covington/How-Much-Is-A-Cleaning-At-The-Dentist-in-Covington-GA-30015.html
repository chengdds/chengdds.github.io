    <p>
      Throughout the cleansing you heard &quot;scraping&quot; sounds and possibly felt 
      small pieces coming off.
    </p>
    <p>
      One believed an elephant was like a tree due to the fact that of his 
      thick legs, another believed an elephant was like a snake since of his 
      trunk. Often what a patient &quot;feels&quot; from their side of the chair is not 
      really exactly what is happening from the hygienist's/ dental 
      practitioner's side of the chair.

      <b>What Does an Oral Cleaning Entail in Covington GA 
      30015?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at exactly what is truly taking place throughout your 
      oral cleansing:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your teeth feel different because plaque and calculus have actually been 
      removed making your tongue feel that &quot;something is missing&quot;. Something 
      is missing out on but it's not your enamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your teeth might feel more delicate since the plaque and calculus that 
      have actually covered areas of your teeth are now gotten rid of and 
      exposes those locations to hot, cold, liquids and food. It is not due to 
      the fact that enamel is missing out on, it is since plaque and calculus 
      are missing. You can be guaranteed the level of sensitivity will 
      disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      That scraping sound is just the hygienist utilizing an instrument to 
      remove plaque and calculus from your teeth. The pieces you may feel 
      coming off are big deposits of calculus, which is plaque that has 
      hardened and stuck to your teeth. The hygienist is not scraping the 
      enamel from your teeth. Enamel is extremely hard, more difficult than 
      the instruments being used and he/she is trained and experienced at 
      using those instruments so as not to damage your teeth or your mouth in 
      any way.

      <b>What To Do With Delicate Teeth in Covington GA 
      30015</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If your teeth become sensitive after your cleaning, there are a couple 
      of choices. Some offices utilize warmed water in their dental chairs to 
      attempt to keep cold level of sensitivity to a minimum, however not all, 
      so let them understand if you are having issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      For sensitivity that troubles you outside of the dental office, here are 
      some things to attempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      Over-The-Counter: For hot and cold sensitivity in your home, attempt 
      using a tooth paste made simply for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prescription: For more persistent locations or level of sensitivity that 
      simply will not disappear, most dental workplaces carry or can provide a 
      composed prescription for a tooth paste that is 5% Salt Fluoride. Ask 
      your dentist for recommendations. Make sure to keep prescription dose 
      fluoride far from children. Never permit a kid to use this tooth paste 
      either. This percentage of fluoride is dangerous to their health and 
      consuming it can be fatal for children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oral Procedures: Level of sensitivity near the gum line can be brought 
      on by receding gums, which causes the root to become exposed. A fluoride 
      varnish can be positioned over your teeth by your dentist or hygienist 
      to assist with level of sensitivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often sensitivity can likewise be an outcome of the typical &quot;wear and 
      tear&quot; on your teeth. Teeth flex with every bite and can trigger 
      &quot;abfractions&quot; which is simply a sliver of tooth that chips out at the 
      gum line. It's not a cavity, nor does it need to be filled, but they can 
      be filled for cosmetic factors and if they are causing sensitivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that it's difficult to inform where level of sensitivity 
      originates from, it's best to simply consult your dental practitioner. 
      They do not know you are having issues unless you inform them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your teeth might feel more sensitive since the plaque and calculus that 
      have covered locations of your teeth are now gotten rid of and exposes 
      those locations to hot, cold, liquids and food. The pieces you might 
      feel coming off are big deposits of calculus, which is plaque that has 
      solidified and adhered to your teeth. Prescription: For more persistent 
      locations or sensitivity that just will not go away, most oral offices 
      carry or can offer a composed prescription for a tooth paste that is 5% 
      Salt Fluoride. In some cases level of sensitivity can also be an outcome 
      of the typical &quot;wear and tear&quot; on your teeth. Teeth flex with every bite 
      and can cause &quot;abfractions&quot; which is simply a sliver of tooth that chips 
      out at the gum line.

      try the medical offices that will house all sorts of specialties, 
      including dentists, in the same building.

      some sort of emergency, some of the well known dentists may have packed 
      schedules and you will have a waiting period. Look into what days and 
      hours your dentist will take patients and what the policies are 
      regarding emergency cases. If you call in to see a dentist, how long 
      will you have to wait? You should also inquire about any policies for 
      receiving emergency care during off hours. In order to have a pleasant 
      and gratifying experience with your dentist, make sure you have checked 
      out all of these points.
